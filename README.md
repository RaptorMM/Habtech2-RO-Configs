# Habtech2-RO-Configs

 Habtech2, Habtech Robotics & Shared Assets configs for realism overhaul. 

Tested and made in KSP version 1.12.3
Tested with the final release of Habtech, version 1.0.0

This set of configs is still work in progress however Habtech will not be receiving any new updates anymore. 
There is no support for RP-1 as of yet and I don’t have any plans to do so anytime soon.
These configs require Habtech2, Habtech Robotics and Shared Assets and their respective dependencies. 
These configs also include the MMU from Cormorant Aeronology by Pak

Dependencies for the Habtech mods:
- Module Manager
- Community Resource Pack
- B9PartSwitch
- Benjee10 Shared Assets
- HabTech Props
- HabTech Robotics
